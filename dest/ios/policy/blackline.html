				<span class="list-item-header">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span>
				<div class="list-item-text">
					<p>
						Video calls via Banuba App are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible, Banuba Limited servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter case, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user
					</p>
					<h3>Personal Information</h3>
					<p>
						For the purposes of this Privacy Policy personal information means information about You that is personally identifiable and includes Your name, address, date of birth, nationality, marital status, phone number, email address, or other information that is not otherwise publicly available and that is protected from disclosure under applicable laws. 
					</p>
					<p>
						By using Banuba App, You grant Us Your consent to collect, store and process Your phone number, username (You would like to go by) and profile photo (if You decide to provide it), as well as give Us access to Your mobile address book in order for Us to be able to enable You and Your contacts to connect. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Banuba App shall not collect emails, addresses or other contact information from Your mobile address book, except for the telephone numbers and names of Your contacts. 
					</p>
					<p>
						When using Banuba App Your profile information will be visible to all the users of Banuba App who have Your phone number in their mobile address book. When You join Banuba App, the contacts in Your mobile address book, that are already users of Banuba App, may be informed that You’re now using Banuba App too.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may also collect any other personal information You voluntarily provided to Us in relation to the Services (in particular, when communicating with Us through <a href="mailto:support@banuba.com" class="link">support@banuba.com</a>). By providing Us with such information You give Your consent on its collection, usage, disclosure and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may collect the content and other information You provide to Us when You use Banuba App and content that You create or provide through Banuba App, including photos or videos. We may collect Your photos and videos and use them for Our algorithms learning in order to provide You with best facial recognition experience. We will collect Your photos and videos separately from Your usernames and telephone number, so it will be not possible to identify You.
					</p>
					<p>
						We shall use and disclose Your personal information solely for the purposes stipulated in Sections 4 and 5. Hereby You give Us Your consent on such usage and disclosure of Your personal information. In case We need to use or disclose Your personal information for the purposes not indicated in this Policy, We will ask for Your prior consent.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case You want to access personal information We hold about You and/or correct it, please communicate Us through <a href="mailto:support@banuba.com" class="link">support@banuba.com</a>. Upon receipt of Your written request and enough information to permit Us to identify Your personal information, We will disclose to You the personal information We hold about You or will rectify any personal information concerning You that is inaccurate.
					</p>
					<h3>Biometric Information </h3>
					<p>
						Please note that Banuba App face detection algorithms are not able to identify a specific person and, therefore, generally cannot be considered as collecting biometric information. <span class="uppercase-text"> HOWEVER, IN CASE THE APPLICABLE LAW STIPULATES THAT YOUR PHOTO OR FACE GEOMETRY ARE CONSIDERED AS BIOMETRIC IDENTIFIER, BIOMETRIC INFORMATION OR SIMILAR LEGAL CATEGORY, HEREBY YOU EXPRESS YOUR INFORMED WRITTEN CONSENT ON THEIR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE, AS DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. </span>
					</p>
					<p>
						
						Unless this Policy specifies otherwise, in all aspects the information considered as biometric identifier, biometric information or similar legal category, if any, will be treated similarly as personal information (unless qualified as non-personal information), i.e. its use and disclosure shall be permitted solely for the purposes stipulated in Sections 4 and 5.

					</p>
					<h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
					<p>
						We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual (non-personal information). In particular, We may collect information from or about Your device, such as the operating system, IP address, device identifier and settings, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, mobile network information, software and hardware attributes, as well as information about Your location. We may also collect information about Your activity when using Banuba App. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose Your non-personal information for any legal purpose, going beyond the purposes listed in Sections 4 and 5.
					</p>
					<p>
						If We do combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
					</p>
					<h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3>
					<p>
						We do not collect personally identifiable information about Your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals or other mechanisms that provide You the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of such information. However please note that third parties services running inside Banuba App may collect such information about You when You are using Banuba App and use it for the purposes of targeting, interest-based advertising, conducting analytics or market research and other lawful purposes. Such third parties do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals or other similar mechanisms.
