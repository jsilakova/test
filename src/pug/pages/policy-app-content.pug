  h2 2. Information collected 
  p Our Apps are intended to create a unique augmented reality user experience using facial recognition technologies and machine learning tools. To make our Apps work well for You, We offer tools that apply filters and video effects fitting the contours of Your face, modifying the size and shape of facial features and following facial movements in videos. In order to enable these services, We have to distinguish patterns of shape and form that compose a digital image of a still or moving face. For this purpose, We may ask You to provide us and upload to the App Your face image (picture or video) captured by the camera of Your mobile device before You start using relevant tools of our App. 
  p We <b>do not</b> collect, process or store the face image. It is <b>kept at the App</b> to let You put available masks and filters on top of other Your User Content (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) when accessing any available augmented reality functionality in the Apps. 
  p We will ask for Your separate permissions to use Your camera and microphone, as well as for sending push notifications to You. If You change Your mind, re-permissions are provided. You will be able to revoke them any time afterwards by changing settings on Your Device or by e-mailing your request to <a href="mailto:legal@banuba.com">legal@banuba.com</a>. However, please note that rejecting or switching off these permissions might negatively affect the use of our Apps or even effect its full functionality
